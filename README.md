2. When the code is run, prompts will show up.
3. To quick simulate (best way to see the code working), type 1 for each prompt until the summary shows up (should be a total 3 times).
4. To manually adjust the data, select 2 (Options) in the initial menu, and follow the prompts to change attributes of the data sets
5. To manually run the program, select 1 (Simulate) and follow the prompts for tracking time and/or deleting the data set.
