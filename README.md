3. The code should run when the zip file is opened in Clion when the Run button is clicked. Use C++ 14 when you create the project 
4. When the code is run, prompts will show up and you should read the prompts and pick the options you would like.
5. Quick simulate is the best way to see the code working. It is the first option under the Simulate menu (option 1).
